- Hat tip to [the author](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/buzzer-or-wrong-answer-20582/) 
for the buzzer sound effect I use.

- I used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to help me prototype this tool. AI
haters please send your complaints, religious treatises, and assertions about
the implications this has on my character to /dev/null. I've heard them all
before and frankly I don't give a rat's posterior.

## Current Status

Works great on MacOS Sequoia current. Will test on Windows and Linux later
tonight :)

## TODO

- Implement some cleaner way to exit than Ctrl-c with an exception :)
- Make configurables into args or a configuration file or something.
- Make the "I made Progress!" key chord not insert characters into the buffer.
